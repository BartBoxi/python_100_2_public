# python_100_2
Second part of python 100 days repo for Udemy 100 days of Python by Dr. Angela Yu 

Copy right to the materials from the course belongs to Dr. Angela Yu. 
All the copy rights based on my own projects are my own intelectual property - but can be used by any github user as learning materials. I do not recommend using them when following course by Dr. Angela Yu -> the more you code, the more you know.
