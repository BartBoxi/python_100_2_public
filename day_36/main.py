    ## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily
# When stock price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

# #TODO 1. - Get yesterday's closing stock price. Hint: You can perform list comprehensions on Python dictionaries.
# # e.g.
# # [new_value for (key, value) in dictionary.items()]
#
# yesterday = data["Time Series (Daily)"][f'{yesterday_date}']['4. close']
# yesterday = float(yesterday)
# print(yesterday)
#
# #TODO 2. - Get the day before yesterday's closing stock price
#
# two_day_before = data["Time Series (Daily)"][f'{day_before}']['4. close']
# two_day_before = float(two_day_before)
# print(two_day_before)

#TODO 3. - Find the positive difference between 1 and 2. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is
# 20. Hint: https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_abs.asp
#
# difference = yesterday - two_day_before
# difference = abs(difference)
# print(difference)
# #TODO 4. - Work out the percentage difference in price between closing price yesterday and closing price the
# # day before yesterday.
#
# percent = round(((yesterday - two_day_before)/two_day_before * 100),2)
# print(percent)

#TODO 5. - If TODO4 percentage is greater than 5 then print("Get News").

    ## STEP 2: https://newsapi.org/
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 6. - Instead of printing ("Get News"), use the News API to get articles related to the COMPANY_NAME.

#TODO 7. - Use Python slice operator to create a list that contains the first 3 articles. Hint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slice-notation


    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    #to send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.

#TODO 8. - Create a new list of the first 3 article's headline and description using list comprehension.

articles_headline_description = [(article['title'], article['description']) for article in data2["articles"][:3]]
print(articles_headline_description)

#TODO 9. - Send each article as a separate message via Twilio.
